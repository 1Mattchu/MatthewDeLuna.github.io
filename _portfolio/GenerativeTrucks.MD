## How Generative design is changing the aerospace and automotive industry.

The relationship between powder bed fusion and generative design is revolutionizing the aerospace and automotive industries by pushing the boundaries of engineering capabilities. Powder bed fusion, an additive manufacturing process, constructs parts layer by layer from powdered materials using a heat source, such as a laser or electron beam. This process allows for the creation of complex geometries that are often impossible to achieve with traditional subtractive manufacturing methods. When combined with generative design, a method that uses algorithms to generate optimal structures based on specific constraints, it creates huge potential for innovation and potential.

In the aerospace industry, the application of generative design and powder bed fusion is particularly transformative. Aerospace components demand the highest standards of strength-to-weight ratio due to the significant impact of weight on fuel consumption and overall aircraft performance. Generative design algorithms can explore a vast design space to find solutions that optimize for the lightest possible structure while still meeting all required performance criteria. For example, the lattice structures that generative design often proposes can only be realized through additive manufacturing processes like powder bed fusion, which can accurately create such intricate patterns.

Airbus's use of generative design to create a lighter cabin partition for the A320 aircraft is just one example of how these technologies can lead to substantial improvements in fuel efficiency and emissions reduction. The ability to save hundreds of kilograms of fuel per flight has profound implications for the environmental footprint of air travel and the economic operation of airlines.

In the automotive industry, generative design paired with powder bed fusion is equally impactful. As the industry moves towards electrification and seeks ways to extend the range of electric vehicles, reducing the weight of components becomes a critical goal. Generative design can be used to reimagine parts such as the chassis, body panels, and internal mechanisms, optimizing them for minimal material usage without compromising strength. In the case of DENSO's lighter engine control unit, generative design not only achieved a reduction in weight but did so while maintaining the unit's essential heat-dispersing capacity.

The customization potential of generative design is also a significant advantage for the automotive industry. MJK Performance's rapid production of a unique motorcycle part showcases how manufacturers can cater to niche markets and specific customer preferences without the prohibitive costs traditionally associated with custom manufacturing. This agility in design and production can give companies a competitive edge in a market that increasingly values personalization.

Moreover, generative design can lead to more sustainable manufacturing practices by minimizing material waste and enabling the use of alternative, more environmentally friendly materials. As generative design algorithms consider the entire lifecycle of a product, from manufacturing to operation to disposal, they can help create designs that are easier to recycle or that require less energy to produce and operate.

In both aerospace and automotive sectors, the combination of generative design and powder bed fusion not only enhances performance and sustainability but also fosters a culture of innovation. By expanding the realm of feasible designs, engineers and designers are encouraged to think beyond conventional constraints and explore new concepts that could lead to breakthroughs in technology and materials science.

The potential applications for generative design extend beyond just lightweighting. It can be used to improve thermal management, optimize fluid dynamics for better aerodynamics, and tailor mechanical properties to specific use cases. As the technology continues to mature, the range of applications is expected to grow, further cementing the role of generative design and powder bed fusion in the future of manufacturing.

### Modern Engineering’s curse
Generative design comes with its own set of issues. The phrase "things aren’t made how they used to be" often points to modern manufacturing methods like generative design as part of the problem. Traditionally, when engineers designed components for high loads without fully understanding the forces involved, they would opt for simpler, stronger designs to be safe. Now, generative design and similar technologies allow for precise optimization of parts for material and weight savings. This is great in theory, and often the benefits do outweigh the negatives. However, these designs usually only take into account the expected forces and their intensities. What if something unexpected happens, like hitting a big pothole at 120 miles per hour in a supercar? If engineers didn't consider such high-impact scenarios at speeds over 100 mph and impact angles above 10 degrees, the car might not hold up. Would an older, more traditional design have fared better? It's hard to tell with so many factors involved, but it does remind us that manufacturing has changed.

The image above shows us a perfect example of this phenomenon.  The generative design was most likely made with the intended loads and the proper safety factors, but the “traditional design” is objectively stronger, and although it sacrifices majorly on weight, it will almost undoubtedly last longer in a rough enviroment.

This isn’t to say that generative design is bad, it's an incredible technology that will increase efficiency and responsible material usage.  People, and especially engineers and designers, just have to understand that every benefit has its drawbacks.  Using generative design when tight weight savings or material usage is not required is essentially pointless in a completely mechanical view.  Alternatively, this can be when weight savings and/or material usage is a point of concern, such as parts used in airplanes, cars, and other energy conscious devices.
