### Top-Down Modeling

Top-down modeling is an approach in design where you start with the overall concept or higher-level features of a product and then gradually refine the details. It's like building a house from the roof down. In Fusion 360, this means creating the main structure or assembly first, then adding individual components and refining them as needed. This method allows for better control over the design process and ensures that all parts of the product work together seamlessly.

**My design is composed of 3 main parts:**

1. **The Clamp:** Attaches to the bike handle.
2. **The Rotating Joint:** Controls the angle of the phone.
3. **The Holder:** Uses a threaded rod and clamps to screw together and hold the phone in place.

#### To Assemble:

Follow the image provided. You will need:

- 3 M5 heat-set inserts
- 6 M5x10 screws
- 1 M5x25 screw
- 4 M5 nuts

You will need to place 2 heat-set inserts in the rotating ball connecting to the threaded rod, and one at the bottom of the post, connecting it to the top handle clamp.

*This design is made of both PLA and TPU.* The TPU was specifically chosen to help grip onto the handlebars. PLA is typically not the best choice for a functional product such as this phone holder. However, I am lazy and it works well enough. I also like to baby my stuff, so there should never be a situation where my bike gets left in an environment hot enough to melt PLA.
